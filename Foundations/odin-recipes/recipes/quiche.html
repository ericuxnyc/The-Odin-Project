      <li>3 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut a 9-inch circle
        of parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pastry crust in a 9-inch quiche or pie pan, gently shaping and
        stretching to fit. Prick crust with a fork several times and place
        parchment circle over top. Add pie weights or dried beans on top of
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the pan on a baking sheet and place in the center of the preheated
        oven. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake about 10
        minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool for about 5 minutes. Carefully
        remove pie weights or beans and parchment paper. Leave oven on.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the crust is cooling, squeeze thawed spinach between several
        layers of paper towels, to remove most of the moisture. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add thawed potatoes to the cooled crust. Sprinkle 1 cup shredded Gruyere
        cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir beaten eggs, cream, bagel seasoning, and hot pepper sauce in a
        large bowl until ingredients are fully incorporated. Stir in spinach,
        breaking up any clumps. Pour mixture over the cheese and potatoes.
        Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Gruyere on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the center of the oven and bake until eggs are set and a knife
        inserted into the middle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from
        the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm.
